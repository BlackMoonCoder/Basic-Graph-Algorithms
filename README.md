# CSC-3102-Project3
This project involves the augmentation of an adjacency list implementation of a weighted digraph ADT and the completion of a menu-driven application that uses the ADT. The project involves writing both ADT and non-member functions(methods) to perform various tasks. One method finds a minimum spanning tree of a simple undirected connected weighted graph using Kruskal's algorithm or a minimum spanning forest if the graph is not connected by applying Kruskal's algorithm to each component of the graph. Another method generates the topological ordering of vertices of a graph using an out-degree-based strategy. The other methods involve a check for strong connectedness, Breadth-First and Depth-First Searches, and the creation of an incidence matrix.
